# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

Based on the instructions provided, I have refactored the code and written unit tests to ensure that the functionality remains intact.
please reffer to the file refactoredProposal.js to see the code.

I made several changes to the code to make it more readable:

1. I added JSDoc comments to describe the function and its parameters.
2. I changed the if statement structure to use ternary operators where possible, reducing the amount of indentation and making the code more concise.
3. I moved the default value for candidate to the beginning of the function, simplifying the code that follows.
4. I added spaces between operators and keywords to make the code easier to read.

I also added unit tests to cover all cases of the function's behavior, including testing the trivial partition key, using the event's partition key, hashing the event data, hashing the partition key if it is too long, and ensuring that the partition key returned is a string. Please see the file: refactoredCodeProposal.test.js

### At conventional commit:

Note that I used the **feat** type for the commit because the refactor is an improvement to the codebase. However, you can adjust the type based on your team's conventions or the specific change being made. Something like: **refactor**
